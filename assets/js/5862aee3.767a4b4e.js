If the stage imports a 3rd party Python module, then you will have to make sure, that this Python module is present in the container image. Adding the dependency to the ",(0,s.jsx)(n.strong,{children:"build"})," pipeline will cover only the case when stages are tested, but not other types of unit testing. In order to extend the ",(0,s.jsx)(n.code,{children:"osbuild-ci"})," image, you need to submit a Pull Request against the ",(0,s.jsx)(n.a,{href:"https://github.com/osbuild/containers",children:"OSBuild Containers"})," repository."]})]})}function c(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,t.a)(),...e.components};return n?(0,s.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,s.jsx)(h,{...e})}):h(e)}},1151:(e,n,i)=>{i.d(n,{Z:()=>l,a:()=>a});var s=i(7294);const t={},o=s.createContext(t);function a(e){const n=s.useContext(o);return s.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(n):{...n,...e}}),[n,e])}function l(e){let n;return n=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(t):e.components||t:a(e.components),s.createElement(o.Provider,{value:n},e.children)}}}]);
